# Questions
PART-A: Implement the following using C++/Java/Python

1) -[x] A. Use appropriate tool to find Host name, IP address, physical address, subnet mask, default gateway etc [hint: Ipconfig]. Explore different options available with the tool.

  - [x] B. On the host system, identify the TCP connections, ports on which the computer is listening, Ethernet statistics, the IP routing table, IPV4statistics, and IPV4 statistics etc. using appropriate tool [hint: netstat]. Explore different options available with the tool.


- [x] 2)Write a program to sort frames using appropriate sorting techniques


- [x] 3) Write a program for error detecting code using CRC-CCITT (16- bits).

- [x] 4) Write a program to find the shortest path between vertices using 
bellman-ford algorithm.

- [ ] 5) Using TCP/IP sockets, write a client â€“ server program to make the 
client send the file name and to make the server send back the contents
of the requested file if present

- [ ] 6) Write a program on datagram socket for client/server to display the 
messages on client side, typed at the server side.

- [x] 7) Write a program for simple RSA algorithm to encrypt and decrypt the 
data.

- [x] 8) Write a program for congestion control using leaky bucket algorithm 
and token bucket algorithm.

- [ ] 9) Write a program to implement random early detection (RED) 
congestion control algorithm.
